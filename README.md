# Better Browser
Aligning web tech with users' best interests.

Better Browser empowers users to shape their own web experience, defining and sharing customizations to websites such as:
- Blocking attention-guzzling web content such as Facebook's news feed and YouTube's recommendations
- Removing distracting auto-play video content from specific websites
- Reminding users to take actions aligned with their priorities, such schedule time with loved ones
